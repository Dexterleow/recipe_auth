# Ruby on Rails: Validations

Create a site with at least two models (recipe and courses), and allow users to signup, login, logout and perform the full set of CRUD actions. Homepage should:

* Show all recipes from all users even if a user is not logged in.
* Only users are allowed to create edit and destroy entries
* Order the recipes by course types.
